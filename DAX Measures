This project includes several DAX measures to analyze weekly, monthly, and cumulative utilization metrics. Below are the key measures used for calculating current utilization, week-over-week deltas, previous period averages, and comparisons against target values.

You have to reapply the similar measures for other metrics like staffing%, AHT, Quality to visualize this in PBI


Calendar = 
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR("2023-01-01", "2024-12-31"), // Set date range as needed
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Month", MONTH([Date]),
    "Week Ending", [Date] - WEEKDAY([Date], 2) + 5, // Week ending on Friday
    "Week Number", WEEKNUM([Date], 2) // Assuming a week starts on Saturday
)


Utilization

Current Utilization = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM('Data'[Actual Utilization]), 
    SUM('Data'[Total Hours]), 
    0
)

YTD Utilization = 
TOTALYTD([Current Utilization], 'Calendar'[Date])


Previous Week Utilization = 
CALCULATE(
    [Current Utilization],
    DATEADD('Calendar'[Date], -7, DAY)
)


Delta WoW = 
[Current Utilization] - [Previous Week Utilization]


Previous 6 Weeks Utilization = 
CALCULATE(
    [Current Utilization],
    DATESINPERIOD('Calendar'[Date], MAX('Calendar'[Date]), -6, WEEK)
)

Delta 6 Weeks = 
[Current Utilization] - ([Previous 6 Weeks Utilization] / 6)


Previous 6 Months Utilization = 
CALCULATE(
    [Current Utilization],
    DATESINPERIOD('Calendar'[Date], MAX('Calendar'[Date]), -6, MONTH)
)

Delta 6 Months = 
[Current Utilization] - ([Previous 6 Months Utilization] / 6)

Delta vs Target = 
[Current Utilization] - [Target Utilization]
